# Feedback-Classifier

Problem Description

Given dataset contains data of feedback given by customers.

It contains a total of five categories: 'Bug', 'comments', 'complaints', 'meaningless', 'requests'.

My task was to build a machine learning / deep learning model to predict the categories of feedback.

# Heads Up
The model contains some entries in alll the fields but some data fields have less data in them still our model is able to dela with it that's why this problem was interesting to solve.
